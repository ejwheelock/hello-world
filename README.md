# hello-world
My first github repository

Hello, fellow githubbers!

I'm a newly made githubber (gitter?) looking forward to learning more about this enchanting place. I enjoy geoanything (so Python will be my jam) and music.

Soon I will be a Competent Communicator and then it will be on to my next project: learn bass guitar with ambition to become bass gigger.

I will eventually be a bass gigger gitter!
